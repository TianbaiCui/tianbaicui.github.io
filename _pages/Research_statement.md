<h2><center>Disorder effects and non-equilibrium dynamics on the electronic orders of strongly correlated materials</center></h2>

<em><center>Abstract</center></em>

*Strongly correlated materials offer promising prospects for numerous applications, from transmitting electricity without dissipation to processing information beyond binary digits. Their exotic properties arise from the collective behavior of electrons due to quantum mechanical interactions. Most theoretical studies of strongly correlated materials assume disorder is absent and equilibrium is reached, which sometimes makes comparison with experiments challenging. In my work, I surpass these assumptions to show how disorder dramatically changes the way electronic orders develop. I also demonstrate that non-equilibrium perturbations enable us to understand different dynamics in various timescales and to search for new physical behaviors absent in equilibrium.*

Electronic technology has revolutionized every single aspect of our lives in the past several decades. All the electronic devices we use today, from personal computers to mobile phones, could not have been invented without understanding the microscopic behavior of electrons. Electron is a fundamental particle that is only about $$10^{-12}$$ of the size of a ping pong ball. Objects with sizes this small are in the quantum realm, where their behaviors are governed by the physical laws of quantum mechanics. In electronic materials and devices, the number of electrons is so large (typically $$10^{23}$$) that it seems to be infeasible to understand how electrons behave, since after all it is a quantum mechanical problem for $$10^{23}$$ electrons. But if electrons are weakly interacting, their behavior can be described statistically in terms of a collection of isolated electrons, which is straightforward to solve. However, this is not the case in complex materials, where electrons become strongly correlated and the single-particle picture fails. Moreover, by tuning external parameters such as temperature, pressure, magnetic field, and the number of electrons, strong correlated materials can exhibit distinct electronic orders in different phases. For instance, as shown in the phase diagram of two typical strongly correlated materials (Fig. 1), they can exhibit various magnetic orders and they can conduct electricity with zero dissipation (a phenomenon called superconductivity). These exotic electronic orders have many potential applications, e.g. they can tremendously increase the efficiency of transmitting electricity, restoring and processing information. One of the major obstacles to achieving these fascinating applications is the inadequate theoretical understanding of all these exotic orders and how they are intertwined with each other. In my PhD study, under the supervision of my thesis advisor, we endeavor to push the limit of current understanding of the intertwined orders in strongly correlated materials.

Current theoretical study of strongly correlated materials is mainly under two assumptions. First, theorists often assume the system is perfectly clean and free from any sorts of defects. Second, theorists often assume the system is under thermal equilibrium. These two assumptions simplify the theoretical models and many insights have been gained by solving such models. However, defects, impurities or any kinds of imperfections are inevitable in reality. Therefore, ignoring the disorder effects in the theoretical studies may bring discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results. And equilibrium is only one aspect to understand strongly correlated materials. Adding non-equilibrium perturbations can help us explore them in a completely new direction that is not attainable in equilibrium conditions. As shown in the phase diagrams (Fig.1), strongly correlated materials are usually in a delicate balance between different electronic orders. Then, a natural yet critical question arises: if the disorder and non-equilibrium perturbations are taken into account, how will this delicate balance between various electronic orders be tilted?

My PhD thesis is driven by this question and it is twofold. In the first part, together with my thesis advisor, we studied how disorder affects quantum phase transitions. Phase transition is ubiquitous in nature. Here in Minnesota, we see the Mississippi frozen into ice every winter and melting into water every spring. The transition between water and ice upon changing the temperature is an example of phase transition. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 1, a transition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity upon changing the number of electrons or holes is also a phase transition. If the phase transition happens at absolute zero temperature (-459.67&deg;F), we call it a quantum phase transition (QPT). Although the absolute zero is not experimentally realizable, it is still vital to understand how phase transition happens at absolute zero temperature because macroscopic properties at finite temperatures are affected by the existences of QPTs.

The two electronic orders we focus on are the density wave order and the nematic order. Electrons carry two fundamental quantum properties: charge and spin. A moving charge will generate electric current. A localized spin can give rise to magnetism. If the density of charge or spin is inhomogeneous and anisotropic like the case shown in Fig. 2(a), it is called a density wave order. By tuning an external parameter, like temperature or the number of electrons, we can completely “melt” the density wave order to enter the isotropic and homogeneous phase (Fig. 2(c)). Interestingly, before totally melting the density wave order, we can also have an intermediate phase where the density is already homogeneous, but the density fluctuations is anisotropic (shown in Fig. 2(b)). This intermediate phase is called the nematic order.

The QPTs of density wave order and nematic order were theoretically studied before in clean systems. Without disorder, the nematic order instantaneously triggers the density wave order, which makes the two QPTs occur simultaneously. Moreover, the transition happens in an abrupt fashion, which is classified as first-order QPT. If the QPT happens in a continuous fashion, it is called second-order QPT. In contrast to second-order QPT, a first-order QPT will have limited influence on the electronic properties at finite temperatures. However, experimental signatures at higher temperatures have been found indicating the existence of a second-order QPT. Then how to explain and reconcile this discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results?

Since disorder is inevitable in experiments, we decided to study whether disorder will change the behaviors of the nematic and density wave QPTs. We assumed disorder to be randomly distributed. Then, it is possible to have a finite size region that is devoid of disorder. The probability, however, decreases exponentially with the size of such regions. Regions with larger sizes are called “rare regions”. Although statistically rare, our study shows that rare regions dramatically change both the density wave QPT and the nematic QPT, but in completely different fashions. First, density wave order cannot exist inside any rare regions. The nematic order, in contrast, can develop inside rare regions, even though the rest of the system is still in the isotropic phase. As a result, rare regions split the otherwise simultaneous nematic and density wave QPTs. Second, rare regions can change the first-order nematic QPTs into second-order. Consequently, combining with the statistical distribution of rare regions, the system develops a smeared nematic QPT. These effects due to disorder may help not only reconcile the previous discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results, but also understand the appearance of local inhomogeneous nematic order in recent experiments. As the first author of the paper, I carried out all the calculations, prepared the figures and the manuscript. Parts of the main findings were presented in the annual March Meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) in 2016 at New Orleans (see the [Talks](/Talks/) page). The paper now is published in the APS journal [Physical Review B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.085117), which is also available on [arXiv:1801.01988](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01988).

The second part of my thesis focuses on non-equilibrium properties of electronic orders, in particular, the non-equilibrium dynamics of superconductivity. In conventional superconductors, electrons form pairs collectively due to the effective attraction between them mediated by the slow motions of the ions. The electron pairs are robust. The minimum pair breaking energy is called the superconducting gap. Conventional superconductivity occurs only at extremely low temperatures (typically around -450&deg;F). Driven by appealing potential applications, scientists have long sought materials that are high temperature superconductors. In strongly correlated materials, e.g. cuprates and iron-pnictides (see Fig. 1), superconductivity occurs above the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen (-320.4&deg;F). Although the transition temperature is still very low, commercial applications of high temperature superconductors have already been available thanks to the low cost of liquid nitrogen. But what really puzzles physicists about high temperature superconductors is not the low transition temperature, but the fact they actually superconduct. The microscopic mechanism of high temperature superconductivity is still a major mystery in modern physics.

In order to solve this challenging puzzle, we need to first have a better understanding of the superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems. One of the key properties is the superconducting gap. Because electrons form pairs due to completely different reasons, the gap structure in high temperature superconductors is different from the conventional one. With my advisor and former postdocs in our research group, we showed that the superconducting gaps in strongly correlated materials also exhibit unusual non-equilibrium dynamics. Concretely, we found that in iron-pnictides, after a sudden change of the pairing interaction, the superconducting gaps oscillate with two different frequencies. Analytic expressions for the gap oscillations show a faster damping comparing with the gap oscillation in conventional superconductors. As the first author of the paper, I did all the numerical and analytical calculations. The major results were presented at the APS March Meeting at Los Angeles in 2018 (see the [Talks](/Talks/) page). The manuscript is in preparation, which will be submitted to the APS journal Physical Review B.

The non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting gap recently became observable in experiments. Currently, we have been collaborating with an experimental group from Ames Laboratory and Iowa State University to study the interplay between coherent excitations and thermalization in non-equilibrium superconducting states. As the first author of this collaborative paper, I proposed a theoretical model that explains the data over a wide time scale, from femtosencond ($$10^{-15}$$ of a second) to picoseconds ($$10^{-12}$$ of a second). The manuscript right now is under review in the APS journal Physical Review Letters, which is available on [arXiv:1802.09711](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09711).

In my future study, I will continue my endeavor to push the limit of current understanding of strongly correlated systems. In recent years, an anomalous metallic phase was reported in the proximity of a superconductor to insulator transition. Although several explanations are given, the microscopic origin of the anomalous metallic phase is still missing. Since it is often observed in materials with sufficient amount of disorder, I will study whether rare regions can give rise to this novel phase. I am also interested in studying how various electronic orders interact with each other in strongly correlated system driven out of equilibrium. I am looking forward to an academic research career that can continuously bring new insights to the understanding of strongly correlated materials.

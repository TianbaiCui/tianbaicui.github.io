My research is devoted to understand the behaviors of the strongly correlated electrons. In particular, I study how random disorders and non-equilibrium perturbations affect the electronic properties. To learn more, you are welcome to click the link blow where I wrote an "jargon-free" (tried my best) article about my research.
[*Disorder effects and non-equilibrium dynamics on the electronic orders of strongly correlated materials*](/Research-Statement/)

In my Ph.D. thesis research, I mainly addressed the following two questions.


**1. How rare events change the Ising-nematic quantum phase transitions in randomly disordered systems?**


In randomly disordered systems, the probably of finding a large spatial region that is devoid of any disorders is exponentially small. Therefore, such regions are called "rare regions". However, such regions can also have exponentially large contributions to the thermodynamic quantities. This is know as the rare region effect, or Griffiths effect. In this part of my thesis research, together with my advisor, we study the interplay between the rare regions and the Ising-nematic quantum phase transition in strongly correlated systems. We found that rare regions with moderate sizes (therefore less rare) can develop the Ising-nematic order earlier than the rest of the system. More interestingly, the Ising-nematic quantum phase transition inside such regions can be a second-order transition, in contrast to the first-order Ising-nematic quantum phase transition in the clean systems , leading to strong quantum fluctuations that affect the thermodynamic observables at higher temperatures. Our findings provide a new framework to interpret previous and future experimental data on strongly correlated systems.

As shown in the zoom view, the electronic spins are randomly oriented in both the paramagnetic and Ising-nematic phase, however, the spin-spin correlation exhibits anisotropic in the Ising-nematic phase.*

**2. What is the dynamics of the superconductivity when it is driven out of equilibrium?**

Recent advances in the ultra-fast laser techniques have opened a new window to drive and probe superconductors out of equilibrium. With my advisor, we collaborate with researchers from Iowa State University and Ames Laboratory to study the intricate non-equilibrium behaviors of superconductivity in time scales that are as small as $$10^-12$$ second (called picosecond). We propose a formalism to incorporate damping to the coherent time evolution of the superconducting gap. Using this formalism, we obtain results that are consistent with the terahertz pump-probe experiments with various setups.  

We extent the non-equilibrium study to unconventional superconductors, where the superconducting gap has a more complex structure. We combined analytical and numerical methods to solve the equations of motion that govern the gap oscillations and found unique features that are absent in the conventional superconductors. This part of work is right now under preparation, and is expected to be posted very soon. So, stay tuned~ :)

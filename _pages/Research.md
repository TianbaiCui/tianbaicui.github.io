My research is devoted to understand the behaviors of the strongly correlated electrons. In particular, I study how random disorders and non-equilibrium perturbations affect the electronic properties. To learn more, you are welcome to click the link blow where I wrote an "jargon-free" (tried my best) article about my research.

**1. How rare events change the Ising-nematic quantum phase transitions in randomly disordered systems?**

**2. What is the dynamics of the superconductivity when it is driven out of equilibrium?**

I served as a teaching assistant (TA) at the physics department of University of Minnesota from 2013 Fall to 2016 Spring.
I led Lab and Discussion sections for PHYS 1201 & 1301. During the Lab section, I was responsible for going through all the warm-up questions and answering all the questions students had for the lab problem they tried to solve. At the end of each lab section, I help students to draw their conclusions about the lab problem and summarize the physics they learnt in the Lab. In the Discussion section, I guided the students to solve physics problems as groups. Aside from helping students understand the physics content better, I ensured every students cooperated with their group members coherently.
For PHYS 2601, besides leading a Discussion section and grading, I wrote solutions for all the homework assignments, discussion problems, quizzes and exams. All the homework assignments were taken from the problems in the textbook [Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Physics-Molecules-Solids-Particles/dp/047187373X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1507669735&sr=8-1&keywords=quantum+physics+of+atoms+molecules+solids+nuclei+and+particles) *by Robert Eisberg and Robert Resnick*.
For PHYS 4511 and 8001, I was responsible for grading all the homework and quizzes.

At University of Minnesota, we follow the so call Minnesota Model for all the large introductory physics courses. I am proud to be able to implement the Minnesota Model which becomes part of the training for my Ph.D. Details about the Minnesota Model can be found by clicking the [link]("http://groups.physics.umn.edu/physed/Research/MNModel/Model.html").
